# SQL_Compiler

This project was done as a part of an assignment for Northwestern Computer Science course 211. It is a basic sequel compiler written in C. It can execute simple queries on the given databases. My assignment was to write the scanner.c, main.c, and execute.c file to parse through, interpret, and execute the user's input.
